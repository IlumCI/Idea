e e e welcome to this session of the school of Communism 
    on the very important subject of how the Communists can win the masses it is very good and very important to have a program and ideas which we approved unanimously on the first day of this uh conference but it is also very important to know and it's a different matter how to take this program to the masses uh before I start a few uh announcements this session is also being streamed for dozens hundreds perhaps thousands of people who have registered and attended uh from home as well as well as 500 comds were present here at the at the conference for those who are new to this uh streams the reason I'm posing for is because there is translation to the different languages the session will be organized in the following way we will have a lead off for an hour and a half including translation and then there will be time for interventions and questions and then there will will be a final sum up without any further Ado I like to call on uh Francesco merley oh there's one more thing sorry Francesco merley who is a member of the international Secretariat of the organization and who is also the author of the introduction to this new edition of leftwing Communism is one of the most important books in which Lenin precisely uh addresses the question that we're going to discuss in this session this book is available from the well read uh Book Stall uh in the main venue and also online at the well read books uh website so [Applause] Francesco well good morning morning to everyone can you hear me yes so we are uh at a turning point in uh in the perspectives for the World Revolution our International is growing and the crisis of capitalism is providing enormous opport unities uh to intervene in the class struggle and build our forces we are learning how to connect with the most advanced elements and organize them but this we are just at the beginning of this process the launch of the Revolutionary communist International is a call to all revolutionary Communists in the world to organize around the banner of genuine bolshevism however uh to prepare ourselves for the tasks that face us uh we need to learn the lessons of the past and we must achieve the deepest understanding of the laws uh that govern revolutions the history of the communist movement is full of invaluable lessons some of them have been uh uh quite harsh lessons and we would ignore them at our Peril today uh as we are um explaining throughout this conference and the school of communism more than ever uh the political and theoretical education of our forces is of utmost importance so questions as what are the laws of Revolution what is uh when we talk about strategy what does that mean when we talk about tactics what does that mean how we work it out what is the method uh that allows us uh to uh work out our tactics and what do we mean when we talk about uh the subjective factor in the revolution because the subjective fa Factor the leadership in revolutions is not something that is proclaimed and then becomes the the leadership it's something that is formed in uh throughout the Revolutionary process in a live in a live interaction with the Revolutionary process so revolutions do do happen and will happen even without a subjective Factor even if there is no revolutionary leadership that's an important question we we need to understand when the masses move in a decisive way and enter the stage of history that is when a revolution breaks out it's because of a deep crisis affecting the whole of society and when the ruling class is incapable of continuing to rule in the usual way this allows the masses to enter the scene we have seen revolutions erupt many times uh it is a rarely relatively rare event in the life of people of course but from a historical point of view we have seen quite a few uh Evolutions even recently for example just to uh to name a few of the recent events which we can call revolutions we had uh uh the Revolutionary movement in Chile or Lebanon in 2019 the Arab revolutions that's uh swept across the middle east in 2011 and the second Egyptian revolution in 2013 all these events uh rocked the stability of uh states that were apparently um apparently Solid Rock Solid and of course the list could be a lot longer uh I don't have time and we are have analyzed and we are analyzing these processes as they happen so we saw in these cases and many more regimes that seem to be unconquerable were broken down into to pieces in a matter of days or weeks of course we can have revolutions but uh a Victorious Revolution is a different matter uh the the key factor without which we cannot have a vict Victorious Revolution a Victorious proletarian Revolution is the subjective factor it's uh uh the presence of a revolutionary leadership and the question of the party of course if the revolution leadership is absent or uh it's not strong enough in inevitably the energy of the masses dissipates after a period and the capitalist will eventually reestablish uh control over the state and society as we've seen in all these cases one after another however as I said uh it is not sufficient to Proclaim the Revolutionary party in order in order to have it and historical experiences teach us that the working class and the Revolutionary youth cannot build a revolutionary party uh once the revolution has erupted in the middle of the of the uh of the convulsions and the battles uh that characterize the revolution in a way uh if you read uh books like left T communism there is a lot of um analogies there are a lot of analogies that Ling makes with Warfare between class war and warfare and in Warfare you don't start building the Army in the moment when the war is declared or you don't go to war without the general stuff although sometimes when you when you look at the history of War Warfare it would have been better not to have certain General stuffs uh but uh the party as the general staff a good a good uh military leadership must be forged before the Revolution breaks out and from our point of view a revolutionary party has to embody the experience of the Revolution movement and its skaters its leadership and uh the membership have to be thoroughly trained and in the understanding of uh uh the theoretical foundations of Marxism this is what we're striving to build today and we are in the phase of building the embryo of that party we have to understand that on a world scale we must build parties with thousands tens of thousands of cers if you want to play a role in the in the upcoming Revolutions in one country or another uh that is what is required to for for uh revolutionary party to be part of the struggle the first strategic tasks for task for the Revolutionary party is to conquer the most advanced elements uh what we could call the revolution Vanguard and organize the revolution in Vanguard with the party now the concept of revolutionary Vanguard as well is not just a label we we put on something in a static way the revolution Vanguard defines itself in relation to events and therefore to connect with this layer that is always changing as the situation is changing and organize it we need to find a way of communicating with them of providing ideas or providing a point of reference uh the second strategic task for the party is to conquer the support of the masses and this can can only be achieved in the course of the Revolution if we attempt to do that regardless of the objective conditions uh we are bound to fail and also that can exact a heavy toll on our forces these two tasks are connected one to another but cannot be carried out with the same methods how can we achieve uh these uh tasks so in order to understand that that's why it's important to uh study the historical processes of revolutions where you can see this play out in a live way in a life struggle and of course the the main point of reference for everyone uh who uh declares himself a communist is the Russian Revolution and I'm sure there are many comrats who are familiar with the process of the Russian Revolution but as Lenin explained uh A revolution is an act uh where mil ions or hundreds of millions of people play an active role uh it's a a creative act it's a an explosion of energy uh of conflict between life forces it can uh very uh it cannot easily be reduced in a scheme and therefore when we study revolutions we really need to uh get deeper and and deeper in the understanding of the processes as they unfolded that's why that's why so important to study in depth uh these revolutions and these lessons uh in relation to the Russian Revolution the lessons that could be drawn out of the whole experience of uh between February and October the history of bism and even uh the first two years of Soviet power which are an invaluable source of uh of U uh understanding from from our point of view on the laws of Revolution these lessons are drawn by Lenin in this book that Georgie Jordy mentioned uh which is the most remarkable contribution to revolutionary strategy and tactics ever written and talking about left leftwing communism and infantile Disorder so Lenin uh carefully crafted this book I don't think there is a single word in this book that hasn't been thought through uh in April 1920 in preparation for the second Congress of the Communist International uh it was translated and distributed to all delegates together with thros terrorism and communism uh but it is uh uh from the point of view of learning this book deals with all the burning questions facing uh uh the uh the World Revolution it contains a scientific analysis of all the burning problems of revolutionary strategy and an explanation uh the clearest that you can possibly uh think of the clearest explanation of the method behind uh that that has guided throughout the history of the Bolshevik party that has guided them to navigate a very complex uh history so the method how to determine and adopt the best tactical arrangements and as Ling said tactics have to be based on a concrete appraisal of the concrete situation taking into account all the forces involved so there is not a recipe of formulas finished formulas that you can just adopt and repeat uh slogans that you can adopt and repeat and that's what typically we see you know in the sectarian approach towards the revolution is just Logan earing but there is something better in this book there's an explanation of the method if you want to see it you can find it and uh and this method is the uh distillation of the Revolutionary experience it's everything that can come out from this very rich experience and an explanation of of uh how uh you can create the conditions you can uh uh work in in order to achieve the strategical uh uh aims which which is to forge the unity between between the most advanced elements the Vanguard and the proletarian masses and beyond that uh how to for for the unity in the course of the Revolution between the Vanguard and the proletarian masses and the larger layer of uh oppressed people the semi- proletarian elements and the PTI B masses and Lead uh the working class to the conquest of power so my wholehearted advice is if you haven't read it you must read it if you have read it one or several times read it again because it's a book that gives you a lot uh uh a lot of very concentrated information and theory and as the situation changes you find different things and then discuss it discuss it with your comrades and discuss it again and I think the aim of discussing this book is to draw out and understand try to work out Lenin's method try to understand why and how Lenin reaches certain conclusions so after the uh uh the Russian October the spark of the Russian Revolution sets uh the whole world on fire well at least Europe let's say uh if we just think about it after the first world well in the middle of the first world war after years of nightmare that is uh destroying the lives and livelihood of hundreds of millions of people you have the news coming in of some unpredictable surprising that no one expected uh the over the the workers overthrow this the SAR just this fact uh is uh you know sending shock wavs throughout uh the working class everywhere and then and then the Russian Revolution is followed uh just one year later by the German Revolution of November 1918 which overthrows the Kaiser this uh uh extremely strong regime is overthrown leads to the immediate capitulation of Germany in the war it's a matter of a week German imperialism has to capitulate and that's the end of the first world war the end is brought about by Revolution uh in Germany workers and soldiers set up revolutionary councils with the workers these councils of workers Soldiers and Sailors deputies spread all over the the country and the Empire and these where the remarkable element here is that the working class enters Revolution and expresses itself uh building the same organs of power as in the Russian Revolution it's not that that the German Workers and soldiers were copying the Russians well clearly they were inspired by them but it's because this form is uh consistent with uh the Revolutionary energy of of the working class it's an expression of the mass power of the working class and then we have uh the Hungarian Revolution with the the establishment of the Soviet Republic and the revolution uh spreads uh through throughout Europe in Italy we have the two red years even there uh doesn't take the the organization of the working class doesn't take the same exact form but you have the merem mergence of the factory councils a powerful movement of factory councils which posed the question of power within the workplace but also uh projecting this power into society These Are embryonic workers uh organs of workers power uh and uh leading to uh the monthlong occupation of the factories in September 1920 which was defeated only uh because of the treacherous role played by the Socialist Party and Trade union leaders don't have time to expand but uh everywhere there is ferment in the in the working class looking for a revolution way out and that's one of the features of revolution is uh that the masses enter into uh a frenzy of activity of Creative Energy they transform everything on on their way and of course you have new layers that awake to the political struggle they don't have uh they don't fully understand the whole experience of the previous period they haven't lived that and uh and and and so we see a a a widespread phenomenon of uh explosive growth for all the workers organizations regardless of their political history so the workers were entering whatever they found available whatever they they were seizing the opportunity to get organized and for example we see the trade unions grew by uh tenfold in a space of one or two years or even months in some cases all Workers Party experienced the leap and this and this influx of hundreds of thousands of radicalized workers uh push all these parties to the left however uh this was reflected mostly and uh foremost in the growth of uh of the traditional reformist organizations that had a more uh structured uh presence the Communist International was only founded in 1919 and uh the reason for the founding of the Communist International was to provide this leadership that wasn't uh wasn't present a leadership for the World Revolution and the Communist International shapes up and becomes the party of World Revolution we stand on uh the the traditions on the history on the decisions on the debates uh that have uh uh uh of of the first four congresses of the Communist International we defend the Revolutionary Heritage of the fourth of the third international in the period uh when it was led by Lenin and troski of course uh it's another discussion uh an analysis of how and why uh the Communist International Dand generated but the Communist International was set up to provide the leadership to this Vanguard and the Vanguard was defined by the attitude towards uh towards uh the proletarian Revolution and the attitude towards the Russian Revolution that was the the um element that oriented or discriminated created the difference between the Vanguard and the backward elements the support uh for the first work state arising from the revolution uh and and of course uh the task at the beginning was that of uh putting together and assembling uh and organizing all the layers that were recognizing uh uh that were supporting that were ring in support of the the of the Russian Revolution the impact of the Russian Revolution was such that in a matter of couple of years communist parties were formed uh with a large base in many countries in many countries uh and in most cases uh the Communist Party were uh were emerging from uh a political split between the most advanced elements uh inside existing Mass organizations which was the social democracy and here's there's also a lesson in terms of uh you know the um yeah the development of of of the real process of revolution here we have organizations that were accomplish uh accomplishes the leadership were accomplices in one of the worst betrayal in the history of the workers movement siding with their own ruling class uh the Trade union leaders uh suspending any hint of class struggle reaching a strict enforcing a strict agreement of uh social peace with the capitalists in order to carry out the War uh such a massive betrayal protracted over several years and still uh once the the working class begins to move this movement has an impact on this organization and of course uh uh the the the influx of uh uh of workers of revolutionary workers into this organization as a as a incredible impact on on them so we have a political struggle developing inside this organization the differentiation the formation of currents uh of leftwing currents and as the masses were Awakening and moving rapidly in a revolutionary Direction they start to clash with existing leaderships as well and so the problem was posed after a period where uh uh just by uh organizing the most advanced layer the Communist Party were formed they reached the point where you could say that uh they organized large layers of the Vanguard uh and and uh Lenin even in leting communist explains that yeah this this strategic aim has now been achieved the process of ideological struggle the process of political clarification and organizational clarification has been completed in a way but uh how then can we as a revolutionary Vanguard uh wrestle the influence that uh the formist leadership still has over the masses because these layers new layers are coming into these organizations that don't have all the political experience and so the problem was post how to conquer the support of these layers that were not prepared to break with these organizations yet and uh Lenin explains very very clearly you cannot approach this problem uh just thinking that by uh means of propaganda by means of uh the struggle of ideas you will win the argument and win the support of this layer and organize you know and grow and grow as a as a revolutionary party so the the task becomes that of uh accompanying uh uh this layer of the masses that is Awakening to Revolution and find a way uh to uh fuse the most advanced elements with uh the masses and while the most advanced elements can learn by a combination of uh propaganda and uh slogans an agitation uh the masses are not learning in this way they uh learn uh they draw conclusions out of their own experience so the only way to win over the masses is to uh is to guide the action of the Revolutionary party that has to show in practice the superiority of the methods but not just that it has to show in practice Beyond any doubt the treacherous role of the leadership of the reformist organizations uh Beyond any doubt in practice and and that's the only way to win over the masses it's not because uh someone decides that the leadership is corrupt and we need to break from it that that will happen happen on a mass basis so one one of the problems the Communist International had at the beginning was that of keeping out the opportunist elements that were brought into the the Communist International by this movement of support for the Russian Revolution so we have for example the affiliation to the Communist International of the entire entire socialist parties like the Italian Socialist Party and for example in the Italian Socialist Party you had a revolutionary Wing you had a a wing that was uh moving in the in the direction of Revolution which was the majority but also they had the reformists they threw and through class collabor collaborators with the bouris and so on for other organizations of course so that's why in the second Congress of the Communist International which was in the summer of 1920 um the Congress approves the 21 conditions of membership and uh the aim of the 21 conditions is to uh separate the international from these opportunistic layers these opportunistic elements but to retain the Revolutionary workers so in these 21 conditions I comres to to go and look it up and read them there are very specific instructions on how to expel the reformists even by name they're named so there is no wiggle room around it not all of them of course um but of course uh there is uh there is a a different problem that the international is facing and that is that uh the formation of these communist parties uh this tumultous growth of the international uh highlights the weakness the political weakness of the leadership of these parties uh the Bolsheviks were a party that was hardened uh through two decades of political struggle revolutionary struggle under many different circumstances and even that party had you know uh faced difficulties and and uh and made mistakes in the Revolutionary process they committed all the possible mistakes and uh these mistakes were corrected and there was uh um yeah there was an education of the caders in the process which the newly born communist parties didn't uh didn't have they didn't have this whole experience this whole history uh the the the process of uh putting together the Vanguard uh and uh organizing Mass uh revolutionary parties in a number of countries was continuing so for example between November and December 1920 we have two major developments one is that the majority of the German independent Social Democratic party the uspd which has about 800,000 members at the moment um and the the the vast majority of the French Socialist Party accept the 21 conditions their congresses in Hal and tours and uh and join the commenter and suffer uh minority splits from the right wing which is a good development that's exactly the aim of the 21 conditions and the result is the formation of mass communist parties in two key key countries uh the unified Communist party because there was already a Communist party in Germany as the result of this reaches about 500,000 members then figures vary depending on on the source but several hundred thousand uh so it is a mass party um however two months later we have uh the formation of the Italian Communist party in January 1921 uh where uh this uh political struggle does not achieve the aim not fully achieve the AIM so the Loro split of the the Lorn split Loro is close here not far away uh brings about one third of the of the um U delegates of the Congress of the Socialist Party to walk out after sharp internal struggle in the party based on the 21 conditions and let's remember that the Socialist Party as a whole was already a member of the Communist International so the Communists walk out of the of the of the Congress leaving behind the majority of the delegates who were still supporting the the third international but we're not prepared to break uh the organization uh but expressed uh confused but uh revolutionary position moving in direction of Revolution and communism around the majority faction led by jinto S and uh this as previous events reveal another side of uh of the problem in forging the leadership for the for the for the revolution which is addressed by Lenin in leftwing communism uh which which the subtitle is an infantile disorder and it expresses what in Lenin's view was the problem represented by this trend it is an infantile disorder it's something that needs the party needs to grow out of to correct and the whole approach by Lanning is to use these mistakes use the experience in order to educate the party Lenin is not afraid of splits but as uh overall the idea is how are we going to reach a clarification how are we going to reach what we need and uh this uh the left communist Trends uh vary widely in terms of ideas of tactics of uh different adjustments and concessions but they all represent this the same thing and uh it's uh the impatient mood that develops in a layer of the Vanguard in uh in the course of the Revolutionary process and if it's not uh addressed properly by the leadership the Revolutionary leadership this can lead to uh very dangerous situations developing uh in the case of the Communist Party of course uh um the Ultima and sectarian positions uh of the leadership of the party and of the opposition inside the Socialist Party in the battle against Battle of ideas to conquer uh the Vanguard where clearly uh the reason for having failed to unify this Vanguard the most Insidious weakness of the Italian Communist party was not in its numbers but was to be found in its ultr left policies and this was uh clearly reflected in in the impact of the Communist Party in the class struggle unfortunately one of the characteristic of that period was also that the class struggle was expressing itself in such a uh violent way uh with violent swings in the situation uh and and uh there was not much time you know in the hands of the leadership of the Communist International to correct these mistakes so for example uh we see the impact of these wrong policies of ultr Life policies in the case of the Italian Revolution uh the Italian Revolution when the Communist part is uh is born in January 1921 we already have the revolution has already passed the its peak with the occupation of the factories which ended up in the possibly biggest Trade union victory in the history of the Italian workers movement but also the biggest [Music] defeat and in fact the ruling class scared of Revolution they understand the danger of revolution is in fact uh during the occupation of the factory we have uh the uh liberal uh boura leaders who are considering to transfer power in the hands of the trade unions as the only way to prevent a revolution they are very clear about it there is uh even a there is even a conversation recorded for some reason between uh the m one of the main strategist of the of the capitalist class the director of corer deera and one of the ministers in Rome where they tell each other well joli the Prime Minister was somewhere in the countryside hiding and they they tell to each other what can we do that's this is Revolution and uh one of the two now I don't remember which one comes up with the idea we need to trans to give power to the tgl that's the only way to prevent re the other says no but this is Revolution and the other says and the other says no no no this is the only way to prevent Revolution uh they understand the role of the reformist leaders and of course they're prepared to use it so uh once his care is uh over and the occupation of the factory is uh is uh uh finished you have decisive sectors of the Italian ruling class the capitalists that fall down and and start actively supporting the fascists they have no trust whatsoever in the in the liberal um uh leadership or in in the ability of this uh these historical representatives of the Italian ruling class to continue ruling using the same methods so they start investing in the counter Revolution so in the course of 1921 we have the surge of fascist attacks against all workers organizations it's like a black tide hundreds of workers are killed um and there is a spontaneous reaction against the the rise of fascism uh workers spontaneously start organizing militias this me IAS are become a movement it's called the Del poo the people's Braves it's involving uh uh workers from all different uh uh parties the Socialist Party the Communist anarchists and uh and uh these Aral pop were gaining momentum becoming strong longer uh but the movement collapsed after the leadership of the Communist Party decided to withdraw their forces uh they even issued an order uh threatening expulsion of those who were uh uh joining these these militias and of course this had a demoralizing effect and prevented the spreading of the movement they tried to set up a communist uh militia but they failed we can see here a perfect example of the pernicious role played by ultral leftist mistakes uh but we have to understand that this is not this is uh I wouldn't call it it's a mass phenomenon limited to a section of the masses uh left in communism in that particular period was expressing the outrage the um the hatred that was had built up over years and years of war towards the reformist leaderships uh for example in Germany the Trade union leaders were denouncing workers that were attempting to organize strikes to the authorities a lot of these workers were then uh drafted forcefully forcefully into the the Army and were sent to the front or jailed uh so you know this process uh built up an enormous hatred for these reformist leaders in a layer so uh if you look back at the history of the bolic party the bolik attitude was uh very different from this uh the tactics of the Bic party was under ling let's say after the reorientation of the party with the April thesis uh was always the the method was uh that of challenging the reformists the reformist leaders to separate to break from the capitalists these reformist leaders the manik to a certain extent we could place in that category the Socialist revolutionaries part of it at least uh they had uh the they had the support of the majority of the working class in the course of the Revolution they were thrown up in the leadership uh of the Soviets so if we look back at the demands that the biks were putting forward which are transitional demands very simple but very effective addressing the burning questions that the masses uh were concerned about peace uh land so distribution of land and bread so very simple demands and they connected that with another demand which was yes an all power to the Soviets but the Soviets were the Revolutionary organs of the working class in embrionic form they represented a a a situation of dual power in the revolution where you have the bja state and the Soviets but they were dominated by the reformists not by the Bolsheviks and so the tactic of the bolik was to patiently explain to uh carry out a mass agitation around this and and other demands and inviting the leaders of the Revolution although they were not revolutionaries but they were thrown in that position to carry out the revolution to uh meet the demands that were coming from the masses take power and Lenin points out in leftwing communism uh that the struggle against the manix that was carried out from the very beginning was approached in a very cautious manner that's his words so he says for example at the beginning we did not call for the overthrow of the government but we explained that it was impossible to overthrow it without first changing the composition and The Temper of the Soviets we did not proclaim a boycott for the boura parliament the constituent assembly but said that the boura Republic with a constituent assembly would be better than a boura republic without a constituent assembly but that the workers and peasants Republic a Soviet Republic would be better than any bour Democratic parliamentary Republic so you see how uh this very cautious approach in explaining in a very clear way the ideas and then he says without such thorough circumspect and long preparations we could not have achieved victory in October 1917 or have Consolidated that Victory and uh one of the things that you uh that strikes most uh me at least when I read I reread the left in communism was how carefully how carefully lenning chooses his words so the Bolsheviks did not win a majority in the Soviets just by means of pure propaganda uh they won the majority in the Soviets because they won the influence in the majority of the of the working class and because they succeeded in demonstrating in practice the failure of the B liberals first of all and the reformist leaders Beyond any doubt uh showing and exposing their inability to deliver what the masses wanted so there was no peace no land no bread and then a decisive turning point was uh of course the understanding uh uh Beyond any doubt in the masses that not only the reformists were unable to deliver what the m wanted but they also were unable to defend the basic conquest of the Revolution which was the workers democracy from the attacks of the reactionary forces and that is uh you know the defeat of the uh the attempt the counterrevolutionary attempt by cornov in August uh 1917 that is the turning point because the Bolsheviks uh managed in that situation to show in practice that they are the only force that is capable of resisting and defeat the counter Revolution how do they do that that's important they apply the same method they openly challenge the government the provisional government and so on to organize the resistance or give them arms give arm to the people uh and they organize the uh the resistance of the masses against the the coup drawing behind them every section of the of the of the masses and leing behind you know the provisional government was floating somewhere so this is the mass preparation at least uh in in the in the cities for the October Revolution but of course they could not launch the Insurrection uh just right then because the rest they had to to prepare the ground for all the rest to join in so they don't launch an Insurrection in September they wait a little bit they launch Insurrection AR around the con uh uh uh around the process that uh builds up to the uh all Russian Congress of the Soviets so the question of the Insurrection is a separate one it's a tactical question but it uh it requires the forging of um of the whole working class into one revolutionary block with the vangard and the preparation for the Insurrection is political first of course there is a military aspect but it's political first because it's a process of taking advantage of all uh of all drawing all the conclusions drawing together all the conclusion forging this Alliance um and uh and you use make the maximum uh impact in order to Foster and create and uh uh enlarge the divisions in the opposite Camp exploit every single crack in the in the enemy camp any indecision prevarication and so so on uh so that's the reason why after cornov attempt fails the process of patiently explaining and caring out the mass agitation with the aim of transforming the Soviets of gaining the majority in the Soviets and continuing the this uh this demand all power to the Soviets all that was the prepar political preparation for the Insurrection without which by the way there would be no Revolution you can gain the majority in the Soviets even uh uh you know unanimity in the Soviets but if there is no Insurrection if the bouro state is not destroyed well then you won't have a revolution a Victorious Revolution that is and for that you need a revolutionary party to organize that so they continue to challenge the reformist and say take power deliver peace distribute the land to The Peasants and provide food and shelter and take power in in your hands all power to the Soviets so that was the preparation for the Insurrection by the way there is an a Very important uh observation by larning that kind of sounds a little bit like side note but it's very important uh this emphasis of showing in practice Beyond any doubt um to the masses over and over again applies not just to the uh process that leads to the conquest of power but applies to the transition you know even after there is the conquest of power and Lenin says it's very important observation because the more the preparations are you know thought and sound the easier or the less difficult is then to uh retain power and we see this for example in relation to a number of events that happen after after October for example uh the uh constituent assembly now the constituent assembly uh well the the Bolsheviks fought for the demand of the constituent assembly they participated in the in the elections to a bouro parliament that that's what the constituent assembly was uh they didn't gain the majority in that because of course the the Electoral mechanism of a boura election is penalizing the Revolutionary forces in fact the results were based on electoral register where there was uh all the candidates of the socialist revolutionary party for example were elected as if the party was unified but but in the course of the Revolution the Socialist revolutionaries suffered en big split between the left and the right and the left socialist revolutionaries in fact supported the the Insurrection and enter even the first Soviet government so there is result of these elections were were reflecting the situation before not after uh the revolution the October Revolution so how did they approach the the problem posed by uh a situation of dual power reemerging on the other side uh they resolved it in the same apply the same method was of course they participated in the elections they had a fraction in the in the constituent assembly which was a Bolshevik U fraction and they intervened the the the the the constituent assembly was convened and the bolik the bik deputies in the constituent assembly intervened forcefully posing all the questions that were behind the support by the masses to the revolution to the seizure of power and they even posed the question does the con constituent assembly support the Soviets to make it abundantly clear you know that the constituent assembly was not uh an organ that could express the will of the masses so once that was abundantly clear then they decided okay we we shut it down you can go back home so they proceeded to disband it actually uh it happened because the guards that were guarding the constituent assembly they were tired they were tired tired yeah so they they decided okay now the assembly is is suspended and and was never reopened and and and no one really noticed um so of course that shows just one example but we can see this repeated over and over again in the in the first years of of Soviet power for example your relation to workers control to how uh socialize how to socialize property in in a in a way that it still works and one step after another the way uh uh you know that uh the didactic approach uh taken by the Party by Lenin by the Bolsheviks in teaching how uh in teaching the working class and helping them to work out the way to run Society of course the question of constituent assembly is all uh uh is raised in a completely instrumental way let's say by the boura it was one of the B flags of the counter revolution in the Civil War uh but the V majority of the workers well I say the totality of the workers and soldiers trusted the power of the Soviets as their own and and that was the the decisive factor that determined the attitude towards the dissolution of the of the constituent assembly in fact I think it was noticed more in uh in Washington or London than actually uh how much it was noticed in Russia at the time um well I'm running out of time there are just the last 10 minutes and um there are many other things that uh that I can say say about the Revolutionary process for example in Germany I think a a very careful study of the German Revolution shows enormous valuable lessons on the other side in terms of the negative side let's say uh the confirmation of the warnings that Lenin uh attempted that Lenin gave in leftwing communism are contained in the experience of of the German Revolution also also also in in a positive way in a way let's say but for example the the founding of the Communist party uh was at uh an immediate immediately after the revolution broke out uh on third of November 1918 we have the Mutiny of the sailors in K and the attempt to suppress that that Mutiny triggers the revolution so we have these councils of soldiers Sailors workers popping up everywhere and uh beginning to to take power in their in their own hands unfortunately the uh most important leaders of of what would become the Communist Party were just released by the revolution so they didn't have much time to to work on the education of the caders of the party and so on in November uh there is like a a mass split from uh from the social Democrats is The Independents the uspd which uh which uh happens before uh in April 19 19 17 the spases were the most consistent revolutionary wing of the of the u u of the movement in Germany they joined the usbd and they develop as a as a a faction within the SPD the usbd but then uh and the usbd is a mixed bag of course there is even Kowski there so just uh there is there is like a a left wing which is moving rapidly in a revolutionary Direction and there is a right wing which is reflecting some sort of um um social Democrats with the Consciousness crisis and of some sort but the reform is through and through so the task would be to to separate uh the confused elements from the Revolutionary part of the usbd but uh in November as the revolution erupts the spases walk out of the usbd and they move rapidly towards the formation of the Communist party which emerges as a relatively weak organization so the founding Congress of the Communist Party sorry is on 30th of December 1918 so just weeks after the revolution erupts and there are two main discussions that reveal the political weakness of this party one uh there are divisions on the attitude towards the elections of uh for the constituent assembly which are called by uh the provisional government by the way there is a difference a more complicated uh situation to deal with for the Communist in Germany if we can compare the situations and that is the social democracy social democracy has thousands of full-time workers they control the trade unions they have hundreds of papers and Roots within Society to the point and they also the bureaucrats have learned the experience of the O October they're not stupid so they don't commit the mistake of keeping up the Soviets while they have a provisional government so the councils are kind of reassured the workers are reassured now it's the time for the for the for us you know for the leaders to take responsibility and uh the Soviets are effectively shut down and then they call for the election of the constituent assembly and so there is uh sorry and so there is a a whole discussion in the Congress what is the attitude towards this election and in spite of Rosa Luxembourg and libn and Paul Levy the most experienced leaders of of the party defend the position of participation they're outvoted two3 of the delegate vote against uh a leftwing communist a rule uh comes out and says in his intervention we' have had enough of compromises and opportunism and and uh they win the argument in the Congress that's uh what I meant when I said this is the expression of the accumulated resentment outrage in the Vanguard uh and then the second question is uh even more uh revealing there is the there is a motion set by some uh area of the of the Communist Party where this rule is applied already that the membership of the Communist party and of the trade unions is incompatible uh Paul Frolic who wrote a good uh biography of Rosa Luxembourg afterwards well came out in the discussion with the slogan get out of the trade unions and uh by the way this was in the same moment when the trade unions were becoming the point of reference for hundreds of thousands millions of workers Trade union membership in Germany Grew From 1.5 million in 1918 to 7.3 Million by the end of 199 so in one year uh the decision on the trade un was kind of uh parked there and postponed to a future conference but the majority of the delegates were supporting that position so the that affected the capability of the Communist Party to connect with this layer of radicalized workers then after just a few days after the Congress you have the sparta syst Uprising socalled yeah which ended in dis disaster Rosa lenberg and car libn were assassinated the party ended up beheaded of the best leaders and at the elections on the 19th of January 1919 for the constituent assembly in spite of all these events the workers go and vote and mass as as uh never happened before of course and almost uh 50% of the votes go towards the Workers Party parties 11.5 Millions vote for the SPD 2.3 million for the uspd the left and of course an opportunity for Mass to carry out Mass agitation in the moment when the most attention of the working class was uh clearly uh as as this figure show um there were a paying uh utmost attention to what was happening with the constituent assembly uh an opportunity for Mass agitation for the Communist Party to grow and sink roots in the masses was lost uh just a couple of minutes more uh and and one year later of course the Communist Party grows in spite of everything but uh this political struggle leads to a disastrous split in the party the left walk out are expelled both maybe um and in April 1920 uh they formed the Communist Workers Party which has about 50,000 members so to give an idea of the size of this uh that split happens after the cap p I mean the formation of the party let's say uh that's a an attempt by the counter Revolution to restore to to to uh drive back uh all the conquest of the Revolution and it's interesting what happens there because uh the head of the trade unions who is through and through right-wing Social Democrat car Lian I'm not sure about the pronunciation Carl Lian yeah is that correct yeah calls for a general strike and the general strike is a solid massive general strike it's a mass insurrectionary strike the C collapses like House of card and the KPD position initial position in relation to that was the working class cannot support either side either side yeah the position is changed by Paul Levy who is uh coming out of jail but uh these other example and there are many others in the history of the German Revolution shows how political mistakes of this type can prevent to achieve the Strategic goals of the of the Revolutionary party I mean in the case of the German Communists there is no lack of sacrifice No Lack of energy no lack of revolutionary Spirit uh but these political mistakes prevent the consolidation of the party as uh the leadership for the revolution and of course um the defeat of the German Revolution because of a combination of the mistakes of the leadership of the Revolutionary leadership and the Betrayal of the reformists is uh uh contributed heavily to the isolation of Soviet Russia and uh the emergence of stalinism indirectly uh because of the isolation of Russia of the Russian Revolution and eventually contributed to the rise rise of Nazism which led to the second world war so of course uh I'm not saying that that particular mistake in that moment or uh another mistake in another moment determine that outcome there were many opportunities to to correct uh and and and and and to carry out the revolution uh but of course these mistakes contributed in disorienting in demoralizing a layer in isolating the Soviet Union so uh just to to wrap up uh we need today to base ourself on the understanding of the processes an understanding of the theory we are in an unprecedented situation uh we've seen uh which which uh actually it's probably the most favorable conditions for uh World Revolution that ever existed uh the world the capitalism is a world system has become a world system the crisis is reverberating throughout the planet uh the working class has never been stronger the reactionary classes that could provide the social basis for the counter Revolution have never been weaker and of course we have the same problems we're facing the same problems as uh the revolutions before that's why the lessons drawn uh in leftwing communism and drawn by the experience of the Bic party and the Communist International are so relevant today but uh it is an unprecedented uh favorable uh situation for the Revolutionary forces so that's why we can say we can say that uh if we if we uh learn the lessons of of uh of uh the Revolutionary experiences of the working class and we do not commit to too many mistakes or at least not the same mistakes not all of them uh then we have the the chance to transform uh the planet to overthrow capitalism to build the forces to carry out a proletarian World proletarian Revolution World socialist Revolution and end with the misery and horror Without End of the capitalist system once and forever thanks [Applause] thank you Francesco for an excellent Le off we will now take a 20 minute break until 5 11 local time here in Italy and uh anyone who wants to speak in this discussion come and see me during the break thank you very e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e okay welcome back to this session on how the Communists can win the masses we now going to have time for questions and interventions I'm going to call Serena from the Swiss section for a question first and that will be followed by Adam from the British revolutionary Communist [Music] party yes it's just a really short question of something we are really thinking about a lot in the Swiss section right now whereas um right now we we are not in the position of the of the third international or of the Communist parties at at that time like our task right now is not winning the masses but winning the the Revolutionary Vanguard and and winning them over and educating them and in that in that way we think about what is the importance of this discussion for our work right now at this moment yeah [Applause] that's thank you thank you Adam Bo from the Revolutionary Communist party in Britain will be followed by hango from the revolutionary communist organization in Spain um yeah I think franchesco's talked a lot about Ultra leftism and Lenin's leftwing communism which as Franchesco said it was um that kind of ultral leftism it had a healthy character to it if you like it was a rejection of the opportunism of the reformist lead [Music] leaders but you also find that kind of ultral leftism that's almost like innate within someone an unhealthy ultral leftism that reflects an inability to really connect with ordinary people to to always be kind of too far ahead of the the rest of the masses to not understand how Consciousness changes and this is called sectarianism and it kind of relates to Serena's question cuz uh obviously we're very used to having to uh kind of deal with sectarianism in other groups on the left but I also think as we get larger as we become a kind of point of reference for the most radical workers in youth that will attract towards us a a layer that that really wants to do something a really active layer but it'll also be slightly imbued with that sectarianism so we've really got to learn how to guard against sectarianism also within our own organization it's important to understand what sectarian is sectarianism is but also what it isn't you know the word sect isn't sing simply a derogatory word that we throw around lightly and it's it's not simply defined by your tactics either sometimes I think there's a misconception that sectarianism means simply someone who isn't inside the mass organizations but that that's very superficial you know in the the years of the Corbin movement in Britain all the groups we would describe as sects flooded into the labor party and similar there's sometimes people these in these sectarian groups who look at us launching a new international and they say ah look the IMT or now the RCI they they they're admitting that the that that the these other groups were right all along and that really they should have been forming a new Mass Workers Party but again that's that doesn't define whether you're a sect or not sectarianism is uh if you like more of a frame of mind it's it's an Outlook that that arises from a failure to grasp and apply dialectical materialism in other words what you see is that strategic and tactical questions are and questions of approach they are ultimately a question of philosophical method and trosky wrote a very good article explaining this uh called sectarianism centrism and the fourth International and he says one of the definitions of sectarianism is a failure to take the world as it is and instead to approach it how you would like it to be in other words instead of analyzing phenomenon concretely and dialectically in their many sidedness their many sided nature the sectarian is always imbued with a sense of formal logic he says they look for abstract black and white uh formulas to guide their actions in such a world a view there are no contradictions just good or bad yes or no he says the sectarian is the direct negation of dialectical materialism which takes experience as its Point of Departure and always returns to it he said he says a sectarian does not understand the dialectical reaction and action between a finished program and a living imperfect unfinished Mass struggle he says the that sectarianism is hostile to dialectics it turns its back upon the actual development of the working class and the sectarian sees discussion as a goal in itself who who is like a man who satisfies his Thirst by drinking salt water and in the end that this sectarian attitude leads them to replace analysis with Intrigue gossip and hysteria now after writing this article trosky then faced a sectarian opposition within uh his own organization the American Tris of the American s they uh there was a debate over what position the Marxist should take in relation to the Soviet Union during the second world war and and this sectarian opposition adopted a liberal position reflecting B and bet Petty our pressures in society said there was no real difference between uh the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany and politically the conclusion of this was that they didn't need to side with the Soviet Union defend the Soviet Union so instead of standing firm against the anti-communist attacks that were taking place at the time these oppositionists were looking for an easy solution trosy said they were looking for some sort of get out of jail free card that they could present back to the the people around them because they inhabited this Petty boura M uh in other words trosy pointed out the sectarianism LED to opportunism and trosky responded in in a load of letters that you can read now in the book in defense of Marxism where we get our website name from he he he tried to draw out the essential features of the debate which he said was one of method an inability to apply dialectics to appreciate the contradictory class character of the Soviet Union as a degenerated workers State and and comrades if they've read the what is Marxism intro they will have read his essay from the this collection on the ABC of materialist dialectics and if you haven't read it you must must read it and study it reread it and and grasp why trosky was writing this to combat against sectarianism now eventually most of the opposition eventually couldn't be one over they split away they became one of the many festering sects that continues to plague the movement today the the they have descendants that are still around us unfortunately and that these descendants have not got any better since they still have no understanding of dialectics no understanding of the Marxist method and it leads them to end up on the wrong side on every single debate in every single struggle particularly over the question of like the Ukraine war for example recently um so I think yeah there's a lot of lessons for us today from from these battles that trosky waged against sectarianism if we want to connect with the real living struggle today if we want to connect with the masses and be able to lead these struggles and these movements if we want to be able to make sense of what is a very uncertain and chaotic world then we need this firm grip of a philosophical method of dialectical materialism as we get bigger and turn outwards we need to double down on Theory and cader education more than ever we need the revolutionary ideas and methods of Marxism thank [Applause] you juango from the Revolutionary communist organization in Spain will be followed by Lucas from the internationalist Communist organization in [Music] Brazil uh I want to start my intervention uh connecting the talk today with the talk uh from yesterday about the building of the party the need for ideas and methods uh we are building the uh basis of the international and this is a vital a phase of vital importance for [Music] us Lenin dedicated a a text paying homage to fedos a man who who uh did the invisible work of recruiting him and instructing him in his first years of militancy uh sorry I'm going to give a personal metaphor Here I Come From Andalucia which is a a rural region uh they all um sort of uh rural rural work workers know that if you have a heavy load in your car you have to tie it down because there's um roads are full of potholes and as lening said the revolution not is not the nevski Avenue a plain wide uh Avenue that's very easy to go down Revolution is more like a road with lots of potholes where if you don't tie down well your load then everything's going to fly out into the air we could say that the ideas and methods are these ropes that keep everything in one uh hole I'm going to give the example of pemos their leaders spoke of Ernesto llau and the empty uh sign significance signifers it's the idea of using uh words that don't have too much meaning in them for the masses in a way that um they can sound good to people of different ideologies they give the example of democracy or freedom in 2014 I went to the summer school of pemos it's not very similar to this summer school they literally said that we shouldn't uh Define ourselves because this could provoke divisions but but it was exactly this lack of definition that was one of the main factors that led to the all of the divisions in [Music] poos I've lost count of all the different organizations that have split off from pemos and what's worse all of these different organizations have lost uh touch with the [Music] masses in the way that it was uh necessary to position themselves in one or another way on a certain as certain different questions it was uh sort of revealed in a in a surprising way the true position of poos that hadn't been discussed in their uh C discussion groups and that frustrated doubly the the membership and also the different uh fractions within poos another good example is the Socialist movement in Spain an example of how not to reach the masses a good example of a bad thing to do basically they talk about elevating the conflict or or uh actually creating conflict as if a conflict was not already uh present and elevated for example in the student encampments uh they didn't know how to expand this movement so they propose ultr leftist actions in order to elevate the the intensity of the conflict supposedly the consequences of these actions would be that the university uh Administration would get scared and would uh concede and at the same time we'd attract the attention of more people but this is completely ideal the opposite happen the University Administration uh shut off all possibility of uh coming to an agreement and the people started to leave the encampments I don't have that much time so I'm going to skip over a few things I want to talk about propaganda and agitation penov gave the key explan classical explanation of Marxism about propaganda and agitation uh a SE can be satisfied with propaganda in the s in the narrow sense of the word uh political party never a propagandist gives lots of ideas or one idea to a few people uh but that's being said the history is made by the masses the necessary link between Heroes and the and the the multitude between the masses and its leaders is formed and tempered thanks to agitation but agitation is an art that's developed with [Music] practice it's not just about shouting loudly uh the way that you shout is important but not just uh the way but the content that you have inside and that's when um it's really important to talk about the transitional demands that Franchesca mentioned this idea of transitional demands is not just something that we can apply at at the programmatic level for example it's a useful idea in assemblies with workers or students sometimes in assembly a bad idea or a bad proposal is very deeply embedded and our final idea doesn't connect with the um with the mood so we have to be um how in manner that's it mild in manner bold in content in order to uh get our idea across which builds a bridge uh over this uh Gap and allows them to reach the necessary conclusions because in truth the masses are intelligent and they know what they need we simply uh create this channel so that this organic intuition can be expressed all power to the Soviets that are on their [Applause] way Lucas from the Brazilian section will be followed by Jack from the British revolutionary Communist Party ah okay no no I I speak [Applause] to okay we'll get there hi comrades my name is Lucas I'm a train driver and we have a branch which is made up of Railway workers in sa Paulo [Applause] [Music] as Lenin explained in his book on left-wing communism in our struggle to win the over the masses we must understand that our understanding is not the same as that of the masses the masses have not gone through the same experience and conclusions that we have and it is important that they draw conclusions from their own experience they need to see not only that the reformist leaders cannot lead anywhere but also that the Communists who are present today here who have founded the Revolutionary communist International are able to open the way for a new world and the and the best way for the masses to to understand this is through experience no and what is the best method through which the masses can gain this practical experience is the policy of the united front in his writings on Germany troski explained what was the united front the united front is not a trick uh trick that the Communists use but it is born out of a need felt by the masses of the youth and the working class a need for Unity to phas off the attacks of the ruling class comrades uh uh we as Communists no we we we we do not have the means to propose we we don't we don't have we not fear we do not fear proposing joint actions to the mass organizations we demonstrate in practice that we are those who propose and build uh that that kind of unity in this struggles we are the only ones who are able to take things to the final conclusion yeah and a practical consequence of these developments is the incre is our increased influence on the masses who feel the need for such Unity uh but also we need to understand what the united front is not it is not just or it is not to uh gather the leaders of different organizations in the same room uh in Brazil we've had a lot of experience of of this kind and it never leads anywhere because the united front cannot be built through agreements at the top but rather from below it was with tactics of the United front that the biks went from being a small minority in about eight months to take uh to to lead the taking of power the the method that the comrad explained in his Le off that the Bolsheviks used has a has a name is the is the tactics of the united front in Brazil in the last few years we've had many experiences of in the last five years we've had many experiences of the implementation of this uh tactic starting from a very small cell of two comrades who were Railway workers and another comrade who was helping from outside we uh we started to think how can we intervene in the struggle against the regional governor who was in favor of the privatization of the railways where I work and so we decided to create a committee of struggle against privatization and the proposal was very clear if you as a railway worker are against privatization join our committee uh in this process which went on for a few years and I don't have time to go into all the different phases we organized the workers and we took them into the general Assemblies of the unions led by the reformists uh in the same way as the bolik did and in these assemblies we proposed what we thought was the necessary tactics in order to fight privatization our aim was not to try to convince the leaders of the reformist unions which we think is uh impossible but rather to try to convince the workers present at this Mass meetings that our ideas were correct and the only ones able to lead to Victory five years and two uh sackings later [Music] we uh last year we were able to build in sou Pao the largest city in South America Two strikes to which the leaders were were carried to against the uh I I comrades I I I I'm not exaggerating when I say that without the intervention of our small cell which now has 10 members that strike will have never taken place and that shows the power of the tactics of the united front it is a a lever liver which allows us to move uh forces which are much greater than ours as a result of the the strikes last year we gained massive support from the population at large workers and youth who use public public transport and as a result we as communist are proposing that this this united front struggle should now be expanded into a an General struggle to kick out tarisio who's the regional Governor yes because as well as threatening the position of Railway workers tarisio is also threatening other state sector employees but also uh the student youth with uh with private public partnership in the schools and the basis for the struggle on the on on the grounds of united front is is there at the same time that I am addressing this meeting here at the other the on the other side of the world in Brazil the comrades are carrying each 10,000 leaflets to uh give them out outside the main uh Metro stations uh in sa Pao calling for a for a big Mass meeting under the slogan of forio on the 22nd of June uh we took that initiative after at at a public meeting organized by the Committee Against privatization uh where where this was an open meeting with an open call to everyone to participate uh both uh the rank and file but also the leaders of the organizations uh we are now building towards that uh rally and we have no doubt that if this rally is a success all the other organizations who didn't participate in the original meeting will come running after us to participate and this is how we build the united front uh from from the rank and file all of us here in the international we need to uh think about our fronts of uh our fields of intervention what is the concrete demand that will allow us to unify the workers and youth in struggle and to struggle without fear because it is very important to have correct political ideas but it is also important to have um to have disposition and willingness to build the organization without which you will not uh build anything in the words of Danton it is the time for uh uh what was it audacity audacity and even more audacity and this is how we will conquer the masses [Applause] thank uh Jack Jack from the British section will be followed by Frederick hello comrades hopefully nothing goes wrong with the live stream while I'm here maybe Nicholas can step in to uh to assist uh so it's easy for us to think that ultral leftism is something exclusive to small Petty Bourgeois sects but the period of 1917 to 1923 shows that ultral leftism can become an organic tendency within the workers movement in a period of revolutionary struggle tens of thousands of the most advanced workers can be thrown sharply to the left and without a bolik organization ready to catch them they will join what ever is available or even create new organizations from scratch for example in Britain uh a small sect called the British Socialist Party which was founded in 1911 it grew by thousands in the late 1910s and it held Mass meetings of of workers in working class districts in places like Glasgow and elsewhere and the the kapd uh which split off from the KPD had tens of thousands of members as well in fact even after the seizure of power ultr leftism can still flourish in uh 1918 uh Ban's ultr left group had major the majority support in both Moscow and petrograd uh communist parties it published a paper called the Communist which is a great name not a very good paper I assume which had a circulation of thousands they called for launching a revolutionary war across Europe at a time when the old Russian army was collapsing and the Red Army barely existed [Music] yet the Euphoria of the workers who had made huge achievements in the revolution meant that they neglected an objective view of perspectives strategy and tactics um in 1918 to 1923 workers across Europe had experienced big Earth shattering events yeah War Mass strikes the Betrayal of the second International workers councils workers militias mutinies the advanced layers Drew lessons very quickly but the backwards layers that were newly awakened to political life uh took the path of least resistance and this is a tendency I would say of all Revolutions in fact even while taking part in Revolutionary struggle the more backwards layers joined groups like The Labour party or the SPD in in Germany and the NX experienced forces of Communism lacked a scientific understanding of Consciousness they felt they felt impatient and even disgusted at the backwardness of their own class and in periods of ferment like this accidental Petty Bourgeois figures can articulate this mood of impatience and disdain one example of this is Sylvia Pankhurst who dismissed the entire membership of the labor party as chauvinist at a time when the rank and file were pushing for a thing called Clause 4 which was in favor of a planned economy inspired by the Russian Revolution of course so we can see that the genuine healthy attitude of the advanced workers can be channeled and distorted into Petty bis revolutionism essentially and this Ultra left impatience can go one of two ways I would say and both are expressions of the of the same thing so one we have a fixation on propagandistic work as the sole method of building the party the road of gradual idealistic Enlightenment of cleansing the working class of its backwardness one by one and this causes groups to lead a sterile isolated existence on the sidelines of the real class struggle and this is actually what happened uh with the early Communist party in Great Britain but thankfully it was fairly easily corrected by the communist International through education reorganization and applying the policy of the united front but the second Road I would say say is a lot more dangerous the road of premature action of trying to conquer political power before Conquering the masses after 1918 the leftwing KPD leadership in in Germany adopted the theory of the offensive and this was encouraged by figures within the Communist International like Zen nov bakarin bakun and this uh Theory said that Communists can spark the masses into action so they tried to organize an armed Insurrection in March 1921 hoping that everyone else would join and of course it failed miserably it was heavily repressed it strengthened the counter Revolution and it isolated the KPD from the masses in fact half of its membership 200,000 people either dropped out or resigned as a consequence of this and this is an example of what we would call voluntarism or revolutionary subjectivism of failing to take into account the real balance of class forces and the stage through which Consciousness is passing and if this was not sharply corrected at the third Congress of the Communist International it would have led to the Shipwreck of the KPD and any hope of a successful German Revolution but ultral leftism like we saw in this period is not inevitable its extent is determined by the size political level and strength of the genuine bolik tendency and it's therefore no coincidence uh that ultr leftism found very little expression in 1917 in Russia and before that as well because the Bolsheviks were able to absorb these lay and prevent them from running too far ahead of their class a good example of this is the events of uh of the of the June days which I haven't got time to go into so a period like 1917 to 1923 lies ahead of us and our primary task now is to do exactly what the Bolsheviks did to prepare a genuine Marxist leadership in time for when the most advanced sections of our class begin to move in their thousands that is the only road to Conquering the [Applause] masses Frederick from the Swedish uh revolutionary Communist party will be followed by Martin from the Swiss uh revolutionary Communist party uh how much time do I have have 15 minutes in total okay preferably one two minutes okay [Music] good in this period that we are entering into many people who would maybe not be very enthusiastic about fighting for a small change they will be very enthusiastic about fighting for fundamental [Music] change because it's obviously what is needed and in the same vein many people who won't come to a bleak Union demonstration they will block the roads fight the police try to topple the government like the yellow vests and I think when we try to reach wider layers of course we have to explain things in a language that people understand at the um at the demonstration or in at the workplace in industrial struggle when you lead it when you make a speech when you talk to workers usually you would focus on a few Central points but the question always arises how do we actually achieve that and I think it can be a Temptation in the C to connect to people that we adapt slightly to one Prejudice or another as we start saying like if we're only enough people at this encampment or if only we go on strike or if only we form a Union branch then we will win but of course in themselves none of these things are sufficient especially in a period of capitalist crisis and that's where other parts of the program has to come in have to connect a particular struggle with the needs of the working class in general we have to connect the basic needs uh with the need for the working class to assume power we need to tell the truth and acknowledge all the challenges all the problems that the workers will face in the course of their struggle and we have to say what is needed because if we don't then the best workers and youth will conclude that that uh these people don't understand the gravity of the situation they are not serious they are just like the others and to win the masses Lenin first won the fight within the Vanguard he did this by boldly stating the truth you find this in what is to be done lennin said we need a party of professional revolutionaries that dedicate their life to this cost they have to abide by the strictest discipline they have to systematically and in every way develop themselves and the party you can imagine that in saris Russia this was not a small demand to make of people as a revolutionary youth in Russia 1901 it would have been much easier to go with one of the other factions where you can sort of locally you do whatever you like you only tell the workers what they already understand you don't need to conduct any revolutionary struggle against sism that's a much easier life but the Revolutionary youth went with Lenin it was Lenin who conquered the Vanguard because he spoke the truth and when equipped with these ideas revolutionary youth all over Russia roast to the challenge you find a spirit in one of these revolutionaries Elena stasova who wrote from prison she wrote my life in this in this and only in this this is the Flesh of My Flesh and that's I think this goes for us today as well if you are a revolutionary youth you see no future under capitalism what could be more inspiring than an entire party dedicated to give their life to the struggle would not that be what you consciously or un consciously was looking for but I think this goes for much wider layers actually but because this feeling that there is no future it's extremely widespread actually you find it among both workers who consider themselves leftwing and workers who consider themselves right-wing and if if they see somebody who is willing to to dedicate their life to give us a future I think you can find many anecdotes and many examples of that they will respect that many will be enthusiastic many will be will be want to support it even if they're not really sure about these ideas about communism yet so I really think we should wear the sacrifices that we make as a badge of Pride we should shout them from the rooftops and we have to deand demand them of others too because it is what is needed to win the masses we need above all of course to win their trust we need to speak the truth when no what nobody else does we need to fight for the workers like no one else does we need to fight for a program based on the actual needs of humankind and this is a program for the liberation of humankind [Applause] thanks Mar thank you Martin from uh Switzerland will be followed by clao from the soon to be partito Communist Revolution got 15 minutes in total okay preferably one or two minutes okay uh if our question here is how communist can win the masses then surely we have to learn from the bolic experience in 1917
    because the Bolsheviks actually did it they went from 8,000 in February to winning the support of millions during less than one we one year and the precondition for that was years of patient cader building but then the condition for it was during 1917 a correct understanding of the objective process of the Revolution unfolding but also following from that correct tactics and correct slogans at each stage of the Revolution and one example for that is the slow an of the biks in the period after a April in February the masses of the working class had overthrown the SAR and the ruling class had effectively lost power to the Soviets of the working class but these Soviets were dominant ated at this point by the reformist the manics and the social reol revolutionaries and they handed the power back to the Bazi in the form of the provisional government which was a boura government and the result was a very peculiar situation which we call Double Power where we had two competing forms of state power at the same time the Soviets of the working class organized and on the other hand the provisional government of the bisi so two competing forms of state power uh based on different opposed classes and Lenin explained that this situation could not be M maintained uh in the long run it was either the counterrevolution the old machine of the terorist state power would smash the Soviets of the workers or the working class takes power through the Soviets and smashes the All State machine and Lenin Drew all the necessary conclusions from that position that the working class had to break with the baz with the provisional government to take power and cre create a new worker State based on their Soviets on their own form of power but to have a correct revolutionary program is only one thing the real art is is to know how to win the masses to program and in April the masses in St petersberg they were really fed up with the situation with the provisional government they were the F the first layer starting to lose patience with the provisional government because they did not deliver on the Promises of the Revolution that is to stop the war to give land to The Peasants and to stop hunger so they were really angry and there were big demonstrations in April and they started to shout or a layer of them started to shout shout down with the provisional government and this also affected a layer inside the Bolshevik party was in favor of the slogan and I would say it seems to be the logical slogan following from Lenin's position when you say that the situation of double power has to be resolved that the workers have to take power but lennin himself he was opposed to this slogan be because in fact it was a call for Insurrection at that point and if you call to overthrow the government you have to be able to replace it with something and to hold power but at this time at this point the Bic were only a minority in the Soviets that means that the masses still had Illusions in the reformists and these reformists in their turn they had Illusions in the in the bu so instead of the slogan down with the government Lenin proposed the famous slogan all power to the Soviet and we have to understand this was not at all a call for Insurrection as I said the the Soviets were dominated by the reformists in other words Lenin told to reformist leaders that you have to take power because you are in a position to do so if you take power now a nonviolent Revolution is possible all you have to do is to cut off your Links of support of the provisional government of the Bui and decare that the Soviet EC is the only government in the country and this really shows Lenin's approach of how to win the masses because he knew very well that these reformers they were spineless cowards but he was not just shouting you menix you are traitors to the working class because you are collaborating with the Bushi that is useless if if these same masses still have Illusions in their reformist leaders instead you have to patiently explain to show is objectively necessary to solve the problems of the working class by putting demands on the reformist leaders and that is what the ultral left sectarians can never understand they would say but the reformist will never take power why why should you call on them to take power but this misses the point of this the point entirely as Francesco explained it has to be shown in practice and the force of the Bolshevik agitation was exactly this they were able to connect the demands of the moment of the movement bread land and peace to the slogan all power to the Soviets that is to show that these demands these basic demands can only be realized realized if the working class takes power and Lenny knew that that the masses will necessarily have to come to exactly that conclusion through their own experience and if the reformist leaders are not depos disposed to take power then the masses will lose the confidence in their own leaders and start looking towards the bolik and that is precisely what happened during the the year 1917 the reformists were draging their feet continue to rely on the bsh wasi showed that they showed in practice that they were unable to solve any of the problems of the the working class and the poor peasants and by this approach patiently the Bolsheviks won the masses over the the year of the Revolution and this is only one example but I would say that it shows the full force of Lenin's Marxist dialectical method on the one hand you have the unconditional defense of the Socialist program and of the independent class position of the working class against all the pressures of public opinion and in a hard opposition to all the opportunists who subordinated themselves to the Bazi on the on the other hand Lenin avoids falling into the ultr left sectarian trap of this pseudo revolutionism that just shouts revolution in the loudest way possible instead the real art is to put forward the right right slogans at the right time which which can which Can Build a Bridge from the needs of the masses to the Socialist program that's what we have to learn cerat [Applause] well comr I uh my contribution is linked to the very good question that Serena post asked in the beginning and also to the inspiring contribution by cover Lucas and uh if we read that wonderful book Francesco spoke about left in communism you see one of the main feature of Lanning political figure if you like my political character when he speaks not about 1917 but about the previous 20 years because what was typical of lenning that he didn't just stop an in a general appraisal of a given situation but at at every juncture whether would be a revolutionary situation or a reactionary situation he always strive to find that lever that point of support through which the movement can advance and the party can advance there is no stage Theory here first we we we win the Vanguard through propaganda then the objective situation push the masses into [Music] action and then the Vanguard can try to connect to the masses it is not like that or rather there are priorities there are stages but every idea if it is pushed to the extreme becomes one-sided and ultimately wrong and in the manifesto we voted upon on on Monday there is an important uh chapter or paragraph named build a bridge to the masses how do we do this now first of all certainly through education political education and by doing something that Ted Grant was fond of repeating learning learn to three to see the world through the eyes of the working class and this is not a Sentimental question this is this implies serious and and continuous study of the concrete conditions what is mass work we can say Mass work implies addressing the masses that is millions of people or even more and this is far beyond our abilities now but but there is also another way of looking at this point let's uh give an example we recruit one worker in a factory or workplace and maybe we we recruit him or her through a discussion on Palestine or on the war in Ukraine or any other subject political subject but then you have a comrade in a workplace maybe of 100 or maybe 1,000 which is not a mass but it is like a cross-section of the masses that is you find all the different layer all the different level of cons Consciousness concentrated in one sample if you like another example is what the British Comm are doing we are not standing candidates everywhere in Britain but in that College in that constituency we will find people who represent all the different political opinions and levels of consciousness that are representative more or less of the mass in general and doing this sort of work forces us to to to um to learn how to address these different layers how to find the method the words the language the demands and the actions that are needed to relate to this reality we discussed I think it was last Congress or the previous Congress about the question of inflation in the world we didn't do that to discuss statistics on economics or to say or just to say things are bad for the workers which are but that should help us to identify a living contradiction for the working class the question of wages of real wages being ferociously cut by by inflation and this is this had a clear uh political effect in a wave of economic struggle in one country after another particularly in USA in Great Britain but also in other countries and of course we cannot address this by just by saying you know capitalism is in is in a deep crisis or even terminal crisis so your strikes are useless or or maybe your strike is good but you must turn it into an Insurrection which is we must go into details and concretely address this peculiar layer of the class which which is advancing troski wrote a wonderful article or text called the third period of mistakes of the third international in which he explained very clearly the role and the connections of the economic struggle with political struggle even in an Epoch of capitalist crisis and so we in in every section of course we have prior priorities we are recruiting a lot of young people we are recruiting with our general political profile with our propaganda without agitation on the war and so on but when the conditions are present which are not present everywhere but in many countries they are definitely we we must also learn how to study this field of battle in the leftwing communism Len said we had to learn how to um to to employ every tactic every tool of the class struggle legal work illegal work economic struggle parliamentary work anti-parliamentary work when they boycotted the Duma which was not always correct but this is another discussion yeah not because we want to be better activist but because these are the different ways that the movement Express itself and if we manage to build some strongholds some point of reference if we are able to sync Roots at least in some section of the class this becomes also a political level a political tool for the general construction of the organization I give you a short example we have a some some of this in Italy some uh areas some cities where we have a tradition of Trade union work quite developed and in in one of these areas in Moda uh when the war in Gaza where the massacre in Gaza came about through the shop STS of our organization and our sympathizers we were able to go call a mass demonstration forcing the the a wider layer of uh mainly metal work but not only that who were linked to the Arab population there and and we were able to call a relatively huge demonstration maybe 2,000 people in a mediumsized town that was that was not a united front with a bureaucracy because since they had a pacifist position and they were afraid of being called anti-semite they said so one of the leaders of the Trade union said if I see only one flag of our Union in that demonstration we will kick you out so so the Communist brought huge banners and a lot of flags everywhere was not one was more than one and of course nothing happened they couldn't attack us but what I'm telling this to finish it is through this sort of work that we will be put to a test and there are all many other aspect I don't have time to go into maybe one day we can organize a commission like yesterday's commission wonderful Commission on youth work on University work also on this aspect the question like that Luc Lucas POS for instance but through this we will be tested our comrad will be tested as a as a members of this organization of this new Banner that we are raising and we will be able to play the role we want to play thank you [Applause] thank you very much there's no no more time for interventions unfortunately so I have to apologize to all comrades who put the name uh on the list but I'll Now call Francesco to sum up the discussion before he does that just a reminder that well read books has republished uh Lenin's left wing communism and infantile disorder with a new uh introduction and this is uh recommended I wouldn't say required but uh re very strongly recommended reading for all comrades who want to understand about tactics and strategy you can get it from the well read books stall in the main uh meeting hall or online from the well read books uh website okay let's hope this whole thing doesn't collapse um okay well it's been an excellent discussion and um a lot lot of food for thought for the comates I'll start from uh the point that claudo raised in in his uh excellent intervention in uh answering the qu some questions that were raised so the relevance of this discussion for us today is to educate ourselves in the method of uh um of how to win the masses uh this is not uh going to become uh you know innate Talent of the comrades just because they've read last in communism it's something that we need to apply in our day-to-day approach towards the political uh uh political uh propaganda and agitation in the way we intervene in the movements uh there are uh elements of mass work uh in the trade Union work as clao explained or even uh on on the youth mobilizations as we saw for example the mobilization uh in the Palestine solidarity movement it wasn't uh enough to go in there with the red flags and say we're the Communist we for the antifa uh that was a propagandistic element in our position which uh uh allowed us to to stand us out to stand out in a way with a revolutionary position but then we had to to fill in with content our intervention with proposals transitional demands on how to expand the movement on how to approach the question of divestment and and so on and so forth so we have elements of mass work on a limited scale let's put it that way and of course uh in a strike for example you have to deal with all the different layers even backward layers of of the workforce and and keep into account all of this when you build uh the the the strike uh so so that's uh that's important because otherwise we would be in a position of leading many strikes to defeat uh but we must learn I mean as an organization uh uh of course in this phase we can get away with minor mistakes it's not like it's not like the March action where the Communist Party put uh the the bulk of its forces in a premature Insurrection it was so bad that in some in some circumstances you had uh open Warfare between the Communists and workers in the factories because the workers didn't understand the call for an Insurrection or they were based for social de social democracy and Trade union bureaucrats uh and they succeeded in mobilizing sections of the workers against the premature Insurrection so of course we must learn from these experiences uh but also from minor mistakes we may commit in this or that field of work but we must correct these mistakes should they arise uh on the question of uh was posed by Adam is intervention it's uh the overall uh um trait of leftwing Communists uh in at least in the epoch of Lenin was uh dual in a sense was dual there there were two elements in there one was this healthy rejection of the existing uh uh leaderships and the existing uh uh tactics and [Music] politics this impatient modood that I described also in the lead of but a lot of the theories of the leftwing Communists were based on idealistic uh philosophical approach uh so for example you know the the appraisal of how the revolution should be not how it is in fact uh if you look at the philosophical background of gter or panoke or other theories uh they they have an idealistic approach they're not marxists uh and and uh and and this is a common trait in this uh ultral leftist uh theoreticians if you and they all um fall into sectarianism at some point because their common trait is formalistic approach towards uh anything their constant their constant um concern is to separate separate uh the Revolutionary elements from the rest but by separating them they're also helping uh the actionary forces the reformist to to keep a hold over a portion of the masses so for example while the trade unions were uh growing from 1.5 to 7.5 million workers in the space of one year uh they come communist Workers Party managed to put together a trade Union of 100,000 workers and in some factories this uh these trade unions may even had leading Ro and and they were militant but uh what could have these 100,000 militant workers have achieved If They Carried without patient work in the trade unions as larning advis them uh so uh what we apply in our day-to-day activity to go back to the question which is I think the most important question we have to carry uh take with us let's say uh take home with us is that we need to apply not necessarily the united front tactic or these or that tactic but the method behind it in all our activities uh in all our interventions and in order to do that we need to understand the method behind it not just uh yeah the form and one of the Essences the essence of the united front tactics is that uh the Revolutionary forces um make an uh launch an an agreement or propose an agreement or accept an agreement let's say so they established some rules uh of the game in a way of the political uh uh competition within a certain movement but within these rules there is uh never a concession about uh uh the freedom of uh movement for the Communists we don't accept uh to limit our ability to create criticize our ability to come forward with proposals and uh uh of course we uh uh uh we propose a number of uh demands within the movement and we defend our right to Def to agitate to defend these ideas and the essence of the united front tactics is that there is an agreement to hit together but March in a way uh separately but of course there is a difference between a strike in a factory or a limited movement which has some sort of mass Eco but on a limited scale and and a full-blown revolutionary movement with the masses involved and uh at that uh in that circumstance in those circumstances the united front tactics becomes vital as a way to unmask uh the reformists the reactionary leaders uh of the working class uh then when we talk about these leftwing uh communist moods or uh uh yeah left wi communist moods let's say uh in in the masses well we have historical examples like the July days for example uh in in the Russian Revolution where a large part uh of uh the working class uh is more advanced than the rest of the class the problem of the July days is the working class in petrograd and Moscow they were ready to take power they they felt confidence they could do it yes they probably would have been capable of doing that limited to to where they were temporarily yeah but would they been able to hold power once and so uh there was this uh Ultra left mood in a way which was a mass mood among the working class and uh we have to be very clear about this there is nothing wrong with the offensive you know or going on to the offensive uh but as a revolutionary party we have the responsibility to make sure that the offensive is called when the conditions exist to win and and uh uh in uh class Warfare there are moments when and like in war you need to organize an orderly retreat in order to preserve your forces and that's through uh even in the small scale front of strikes for example you can't always launch or relaunch the offensive the strike you know uh you have to it has to be based on on the concrete circumstances and sometimes uh in order to preserve the forces uh in a trade Union struggle you have to reach uh a deal that is not what you were aiming for the important thing is the way this is presented we don't claim a defeat for a victory we always speak we always tell the truths it's not a question of prestige it's a question of uh educating our forces educating uh our forces uh for the Revolutionary Pro uh Prospect I'm running out of time I wanted to focus on one uh uh last uh question is the the approach taken by Lenin in all this turbulent period was that of uh educating the Vanguard educating the most advanced elements the revolutionaries so when you read the postcript to to leting Communism the Lenin wrote in May uh 1920 V uh which is an integral part of the book uh you you can read his reaction to the news that the Communist Workers Party uh was formed and split from the Communist party and he he welcomed the the news of the split in a way although it was a dis disaster split for for the Communist party uh but because it brought about Clarity but then if you read uh the following uh The Following part of Lenin's appraisal of the situation is is saying uh well now they have to prove that their perspective Ives their methods their ability to lead the working class to power is correct and he he was convinced that through experience uh uh the Communist International would be able to recover uh a large part of the people that were kind of misled uh onto onto that path so he insisted uh for example in the fact that the split itself uh well was probably a necessary step but that uh the the Communist Party leadership should make every effort in order to not create any additional barrier for the future reunification uh of the Revolutionary forces on a higher level uh in fact this tactic work worked out in many different ways the Communist Workers Party had a played an important role in the first the events around uh around 1920 1921 but then imploded and became less relevant for us and a large part of the workers that were following uh these left communist ideas were then reintegrated in the Communist Party so I think uh what we need to take home is that as a revolutionary communist International everyone of our comates must uh uh study must be uh must must assimilate uh the method of Marxism uh the essence of Lenin's uh uh leftwing communism and all his works is well brought out in in Lenin's biography written by Rob SW and Alan Woods that we published recently which is a political biography of Lenin uh and and shows uh how Lenin's method worked throughout in very different circumstances I was always uh the same method so from our point of view whatever we do whatever successes we achieve in our activities they would be completely irrelevant if they were not based on a full understanding of the Maxis method we need to build our organization on the solid rock of Marxist theory and the only way to do it is to to to to use our knowledge whatever we have and intervene in the in the movement and learn from this experience and study more and build our forces and intervene uh again so as clao pointed out there are no stages from this point of view there are just logical stages to help you know understanding something it's not that now we raise the Communist flag and the Vanguard will flock to us and tomorrow when the masses move well we will have a party of tens of thousands and we will be able to intervene in that I'm sure no comrad thinks in this uh way but if if you do think twice uh study more discuss with your comrades and I'm sure we will move forward uh to achieve our Targets in the future thanks [Applause] thank you everyone this is the end of this session this afternoon is the free afternoon but for those of you following from home and uh let's remember there's there's been over 7,000 people registered to the school of Communism from 120 different countries a a reminder a reminder that all sessions of the school are available online not only to watch as they are happening but also uh afterwards you can you can find them on the you can find them on the schoolof communism.com website and on the marxist.com YouTube channel so thank you very much the sessions will continue tomorrow morning [Applause]</p>
